# My Profile

This is my shortcut to all my projects I have made/contributed towards.
For the time being I just have a couple placeholders to make the page not look so empty.
As I finish more projects this page will grow.

## CSS/HTML Layout

The main focus of this profile(for the time being):
* Is to make a html layout that flows from top to bottom with a header to a footer with sections in between.
* Used css to add some small features for style examples being smoothing borders and use of single border lines for design.
